<h1>
    Welcome to Inoculates Applications
</h1>

<p>
    My love for programming began in a very humble environment. Back around the early 2000's when I was very young,
    I used to program Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne games. Though my youthful inexperience prevented me from
    completing any of these custom games, my passion for programming was both sparked and stoked through my early attempts,
    and I learned a great deal of coding principles from the psuedo-language JASS.
    <br><br>
    As I grew, I began to learn actual
    programming languages, and utilized my newly gained knowledge to create the various programs on this site.
    These applications are not only an expression of my love for programming, but also show how far I've come as a
    software developer since I began. Additionally, these projects greatly boosted my knowledge each individual
    programming languages and software development as a whole.
</p>
<p>
    This site is a compilation of all the different projects I've worked on thus far. These have been written in a
    variety of languages and are based on different rendering engines.
    <br><br>
    Note that these projects are coded without the use of any software to develop them (other than IDE's). This means
    means that they are for the most part written completely from scratch (some entirely so), and can be read solely
    based on knowledge accrued from study of the various programming languages. Enjoy!

    How This Website Was Made
</h2>
<p>
    This site was made in very basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its code can be easily read and modified, and can serve
    as a beginner's learning tool. Its purpose was to help me learn and apply the basic techniques of web development.
    Unlike my knowledge of software language and development, my experience in the realm of web development is very
    little, and I sought to improve it through the construction of this Website.
